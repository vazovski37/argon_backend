# History of Poti

## Ancient Origins

Poti is an ancient city located on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in western Georgia. In antiquity, it was known as Phasis, named after the Phasis River (modern Rioni). According to Greek mythology, this was where Jason and the Argonauts landed in their quest for the Golden Fleece.

## The Kingdom of Colchis

The Kingdom of Colchis, of which Phasis (modern Poti) was a major city, was known throughout the ancient world for its wealth and sophistication. The kingdom flourished from the 6th to the 1st century BC. Colchis was famous for its gold - the ancient practice of placing sheep fleeces in mountain streams to catch gold particles may have given rise to the Golden Fleece legend.

## Greek Colonization

Greek colonists from Miletus established a trading post at Phasis around the 6th century BC. The city became an important link in trade routes connecting Greece with the Caucasus and Central Asia. Goods like gold, timber, honey, and linen flowed through its port.

## Medieval Period

After the fall of Rome, the region came under Byzantine influence. The city was rebuilt multiple times and served as an important military and trade outpost. Georgian kingdoms gradually consolidated control over the region, and Poti remained a strategic port.

## Russian Empire Era

In 1828, after the Russo-Turkish War, Poti came under Russian control. The modern city began to take shape in the 1850s when a new port was constructed. The famous Poti Lighthouse was built in 1864, marking the development of serious maritime infrastructure.

## Soviet Period

During the Soviet era, Poti became one of the major ports of the USSR on the Black Sea. The city's infrastructure expanded significantly, including industrial facilities, railways, and modern port facilities.

## Independent Georgia

Since Georgia's independence in 1991, Poti has remained one of the country's most important ports. It serves as a gateway for trade between Europe and Asia, particularly as part of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA).
